     * maintaining a stack of choices. During each iteration, the choice at the
     * top of the stack is examined. If choice.isEmpty() is true, then we have
     * reached a dead-end and must backtrack by popping the stack. If the choice
     * is not empty, then we proceed down the first path in the list of options.
     * If the exit is encountered, then SolutionFound is thrown and we generate
     * the solution path, which we return. At any given point in the execution,
     * the list of first choices yields the current path. That is, if the choice
     * stack is:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * [[E W S] [E W] [S N] [N]]
     * </pre>
